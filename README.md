## Description

Puppet module for the management of AIDE - Advanced Intrusion Detection
Enviroment.

## Setup

### Beginning with aide

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This
can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most
basic use of the module.

## Usage

This section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do the
fancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you include usage
examples and code samples for doing things with your module.

## Reference

Here, include a complete list of your module's classes, types, providers,
facts, along with the parameters for each. Users refer to this section (thus
the name "Reference") to find specific details; most users don't read it per
se.

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there
are Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.

## Contributors

Pull requests are welcome. Please ensure any code follows the Puppet Style
Guide and that new functionality is provided with unit tests using rspec.
